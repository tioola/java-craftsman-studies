Study Project
---

This code is a study project of the book **Java by Comparison- (Simon Harrer)** and only contains examples made by myself following some concepts that I think
are relevante to take notes. Do not use this project as your study guide, please buy the book first and if you want different examples with the concepts used you can
look into this project. 

**Friendly Reminder:** Not all examples should be in this project since not all of them I consider interesing or are too basic. This project was created for self study therefore not
considering a general public.


Study Framework
--- 

Every chapter will be in a package with the summary of the chapter in a markdown file. You can look at the
tests folder to check detailed examples.

Also I created a Quick Notes sections for every chapter for quotes or notes that are relevante but do not require a test for themselves.
